# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT

#### **Project Summary**
In this sentiment analysis project, we need to identify the scope of the project. This system can be used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers. This is system will only accept the text which is in English. Therefore, countries or companies that do not use English as their primary language cannot use this system.
#### Customer : Intel
#### Project name: Sentiment Analysis in Business

## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

#### Project Management Life-Cycle
The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which we divide our project into manageable stages with each phases listed that combine our project idea into a working syste.<br>

<p align="center">Figure 1: Gantt Chart </p>

#### WBS is constructed to make the works more organizable as listed below. 
It used to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as Project Conception & Initiation, Project Definition & Planning, Project Launch & Execution, Project Monitoring and Project Closure.

#### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? |	How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
| :---: | --- |---|---|
| Quality | The system cannot differentiate the positive or negative sentiment in text correctly. | How: The model has a bad performance which give us bad result.<br><br> When: The problem will be encountered when we train the model. | Tune the model parameters such as learning rate or train a more complex model. |                   
| Cost | 1. High usage of Internet and high bandwidth is required.<br><br>2. The project cost reaches the budget limit | How: Website is loaded is slow speed<br><br>When: The problem will be encountered when we are doing web scraping. | Discuss with the stakeholders about the usage of internet to upgrade the bandwidth. |    
| Time | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set as described in the Gantt Chart.<br><br>2. Time consuming to collect the data. | How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members<br><br>When: The problem will be encountered during the project execution and monitoring phase. | Ask for the help from other members to solve the problem or switch job with another member in the team. |
